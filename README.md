# barabasi_albert

This is a simple animation GUI in python aims to show the growth of the barabasi_albert scale free graph.

Running : python BA.py

needed libraries: pylab, networkx, matplotlib and Tkinter.

Using the GUI, fill the text boxes as follows: 
1- Number of nodes : total number of nodes in the graph
2- Starting nodes: nodes at the very beginning of the graph growth process (must be smaller than total number of nodes)
3- New nodes edges : number of edges a newly added node will use to connect to existing nodes (must be smaller than starting nodes)
4- Pause time : time between the addition of each new node(in seconds)


This work was realized in December 2015 as a part of the course: Evaluation of Network Algorithm Efficiency, under the supervision of prof. Joanna Tomasik in Telecom SudParis, France.
